## Portfolio API

* Get familiar with the project and how things work
* Create your own Controllers for routes 
* Routes should be based on REST (/posts) for GET, POST

Don't create specific rest endpoints (/posts/:id) because it won't work yet

**Always branch out**

### Branches

Master [production, locked]

Dev [development, all dev sub branches should merge in this one]

Naming convention for branching

### *{githubusername}/{type}/{mini desc OR Jira task number}*

example:

backspacerhino/fix/route-handler
backspacerhino/feature/specific-endpoint-handler


Or in case of JIRA tasks (we don't have this but it's good to know)

backspacerhino/fix/PA-32
backspacerhino/feature/PA-11

P.S. This is a really shitty readme file, will update later
